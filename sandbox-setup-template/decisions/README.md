## About ADRs

Architecture Decision Records capture important architectural decisions made during the design and implementation of a system. Each ADR describes:

- **Context**: The situation and forces at play
- **Decision**: What was decided
- **Options Considered**: Alternatives evaluated with pros/cons
- **Consequences**: The resulting impact

### Template

New ADRs should follow the [MADR template](0000-template.md).

### Statuses

- **Proposed**: Under discussion
- **Accepted**: Approved and in effect
- **Deprecated**: No longer valid
- **Superseded**: Replaced by another ADR
